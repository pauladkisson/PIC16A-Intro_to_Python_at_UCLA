   Do not worry if your colors are a little different from mine.
       0 = garbage
       1 = okay, 
           but there's lots of noise in the image 
           because you've been careless about data types
       2 = really good, but you have a difference missing or minor noise
       3 = perfect

3) 5pts 
   For full credit, it is important you have NOT cut off Tomas Haake's arm.
   It is also important that you have minimal green halo (some is fine).

   If you couldn't put the minion on Meshuggah, 
   and just removed the green screen from the minion...
       0 = garbage
       1 = you have attempted to remove the green screen, and done poorly
       2 = you have successfully made the green screen black with minimal halo

   Hopefully, you put the minion onto Meshuggah...
       3 = Tomas Haake's arm is missing
       4 = minor imperfections that the grader thinks deserve punishment
           (like really quite a lot of halo left over)
       5 = perfect
